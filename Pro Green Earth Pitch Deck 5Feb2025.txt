BAROTSE RANGELANDS FOR RESTORATION

TRANSFORMING LIVELIHOODS AND RESTORING CARBON IN THE RANGELANDS OF ZAMBIA'S WESTERN PROVINCE



Pro Green Earth Zambia, January 2025


Project Vision:
The Barotse Rangelands for Restoration Project (BR4RP) aims to drive systemic change and foster regenerative livelihoods
within Zambia's Western Province. By implementing improved livestock production and rangeland management programs,
across 1.2 million hectares, the project will enhance ecosystem biodiversity, increase soil carbon sequestration, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improving the resilience of
landscapes and food systems to climate change.



Impact Highlights:

Improved cattle production and value could increase farmer incomes by $3.3 million per year



Over 34 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent could be sequestered over 40 years


Funding Requirement:
To develop the initial project
instance of 200,000 hectares,
$10.2M is required, derived from:
• Debt at ($5M)
• VCU sales ($5.2M)



• Cattle population of Western Province has
decreased from more than 700,000 in 2006 to less
than 450,000 in 2022 (Ministry of Livestock Census data)
• Lack of capacity, and access to inputs and markets, which leads to
poor economic outcomes, and creates little incentive to manage rangelands
• These pictures are taken on the same day, less than 10km apart, indicating the potential of improved management

The Barotse people, with their strong cultural and historical affinity to
cattle, are central to this project. The BR4RP will co-design and co-develop rangeland management and livestock production activities, alongside
farming communities and the Barotse Royal Establishment (BRE), to
achieve significant positive outcomes for both the people and the
environment they depend on. The project aims to:
• Enhance livelihoods, food security and climate resilience
• Promote environmental
restoration and conservation
• Foster inclusive economic growth
• Increase biodiversity
• Remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by increasing soil carbon stocks


Pro Green Earth (PGE) is a Zambian company established specifically to implement the BR4RP, a project conceived at the request of his Majesty the Litunga, King of the Barotse people. The organisation is a joint venture between: Leopard Investments Company Ltd, a successful agri-business since 1958, with longstanding ties to the BRE; Impuls Africa, providing agricultural consultancy, capacity building and extension services to farmers throughout the region for the past 13 years; and Lucy Pieterse, an environmental scientist with extensive experience in successful carbon project development in Zambia.
PGE is developing this project in partnership with the BRE, with the full support of the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, and the Ministry of Green Economy and Environment.

PGE and has drafted a Social Safeguards Policy, approved by the BRE, to ensure the project does no harm and has a positive impact on local stakeholders, which contains further details on the governance structure described above.


Benefit Sharing Mechanism

The Social Safeguards Policy also further describes the benefit sharing mechanism based on gross carbon revenue, in which both the BRE and the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) each receive 5%, and the remaining 90% is reinvested in the project and communities.





Rangeland Management

Capacity Building

Livestock Production




• Provide soil and vegetation monitoring data to facilitate participatory land-use planning
• Deploy improved, strategic approaches to fire and grazing management
• Implement water harvesting techniques and restore, develop, and protect community water points
• Design communal grazing structures and night kraals with solar tech
• Create farmer fodder banks
• Establish bio-digestors for improved manure management


• Build capacity through technical training and demonstration farms
• Develop additional livelihoods (complementary and circular economy-focused)
• Integrate sustainable behaviour change incentives
• Increase business management capacity
• Leverage additional resources from development partners
• Deepen governance capacity building for effective benefit sharing distribution and utilization
• 
Improve extension services, inputs and information (disease testing, vaccines, training, SMS system)
• Enhance breeding (timing synchronization, AI, dual-purpose genetics, bull replacement)
• Establish traceability (electronic ID, ear tagging and ownership certificates)
• Strengthen nutrition (protein, transition, and phosphate licks, silvopasture development)
• Implement a Regenerative Dairy Ranching model (dual incomes)



The BR4RP will employ state of the art environmental monitoring, reporting and verification systems, to ensure effective and adaptive management strategies provide maximum environmental benefit to farmers, and generate carbon credits with very high environmental integrity.

The development share of the gross carbon revenue from each project instance will cover all development and ongoing MRV costs for that instance, and the development of additional nature based revenue streams (e.g. emissions intensity certification and biodiversity credits) and project instances.




Disease and Mortality
• Preventative measures or treatment deployed for the most prevalent local diseases
• Liver condemnation (due to liver fluke) reduced from more than 80% to less than 15%
• Average mortality rates reduced from 10% to 5%


Reproduction and Herd Structure
• Reproduction rate (calving rate) increased from less than 30% to more than 60%
• Average age of cattle brought to market reduced from over 5 years to under 3 years
• Average carcass weight of cattle brought to market increased by 50kg


Grazing and Nutrition
• Supplementary feeding and fodder banks developed, gut microbiome diversity and digestion efficiency improved, and enteric methane emissions intensity reduced
• Average carbon sequestration rates over project areas reversed from net loss to 0.8 tCO2e per hectare per year with increased biodiversity (vegetation and soil microbiome)




Cattle as a Business
• Average annual off-take increased from around 8% to more than 15%
• Average carcass value increased from ZMW 36/kg to ZMW 54/kg


This could result in approximately..
• ZMW 6,500 extra income per animal brought to market
• ZMW 25,000 extra income from beef sales per farmer, per year
• ZMW 355 million extra income per year across the full project area (1.2 million ha), without increasing total herd size (240,000 animals)

Dual Purpose Genetics
• Daily lactation increased from 4 liters to 8 liters per animal
• Lactation period increased from 90 to 200 days per year
• Allocating 5 liters per day for the calf, and 1 liter for household consumption, 2 liters can be sold, realizing the farmer ZMW 6,600 from milk sales per year


Required financing:
The initial project instance requires an investment of $10.2 million to achieve financial self sustainability through ongoing VCU sales. Livestock production co-benefit costs equate to roughly half the total budget, making the project highly suitable for development finance.


Direct community benefit activity costs:
The budget includes approx. $7.5 million (63% of total) for activities that directly benefit communities, over the first 5 years.




High Integrity Net Carbon Removals
The project will expects to achieve average annual net carbon removals of 0.8 tons CO2e per hectare, across the project areas, over a forty year crediting period.

Social integrity:
• Regenerative agriculture carbon removals, such as these, offer an advantage over those generated through conservation or reforestation, as carbon is sequestered through a non- competing land use that simultaneously enhances food production.
• The co-design and development strategy ensures social safeguarding, efficient implementation, and equitable benefit sharing.

Environmental integrity:
• The same activities that generate carbon removals in regenerative agriculture simultaneously create significant socio-economic benefits, thereby increasing the likelihood of long-term practice adoption and carbon sequestration permanence.
• Leakage risk is minimal, as these activities enhance, rather than displace existing livelihoods.
